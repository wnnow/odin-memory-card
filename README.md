# Odin Memory Card

This repository is part of The Odin Project (TOP) Full Stack JavaScript learning path. It uses `useEffect` and `useState` in React to build a memory card game.

## Game Description

The memory card game challenges the user to click on every unique picture without clicking any picture twice. If the user clicks the same picture twice, the game will reset. The game features a real-time scoreboard displaying the current score and the high score. When the game resets, the high score remains unchanged, while the current score resets to zero.

## Features

- Click unique pictures to increase your score.
- Real-time scoreboard updates.
- High score remains after the game resets.
- Game resets upon clicking the same picture twice.
